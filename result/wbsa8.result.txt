Question 2: Making eye contact generally shows confidence, interest, and attentiveness. However, avoiding eye contact can indicate shyness, nervousness, or even deceit in some cultures.

Question 3: Fidgeting can signal anxiety, impatience, or boredom. However, it can also be a sign that someone is deep in thought or trying to process information.

Question 4: A smile is often a universal sign of happiness, friendliness, or approval. However, it can also be used to mask discomfort or nervousness. Pay attention to whether the smile reaches the eyes for a more genuine indication.
